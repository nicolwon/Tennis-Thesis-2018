Please note: files 'completePoints.csv' and 'pointsWithImp.csv' are too large to be uploaded on github. However, they can be reproduced as follows:

1) completePoints.csv - after running pointWinProbCalc.r, add the following line: write.csv(pointsdata, 'completePoints'.csv)
2) pointsWithImp.csv - run container.m in the KlassenMagnus/2019_01_27_imp folder
